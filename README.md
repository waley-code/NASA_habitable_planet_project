# NASA_habitable_planet_project

### This project sought to examine names of habitable planets
    Using data gotten from the Kepler telescope of NASA Exoplanet Archive

### Insights

    Over 9,000 Planets was discovered from the NASA Exoplanet Archive of which 8 was determined habitable
    based on the following factors;
        1. koi_disposition: Exoplanet Archive Disposition == 'CONFIRMED'
        2. koi_insol:      Insolation Flux [Earth flux] > 0.36
        3. koi_insol:      Insolation Flux [Earth flux] < 1.11
        4. koi_prad:       Planetary Radius [Earth radii] < 1.6

### Results

    The following Planets were the results gotten from this research
            - Kepler-1652 b
            - Kepler-1410 b
            - Kepler-296 f
            - Kepler-442 b
            - Kepler-296 e
            - Kepler-1649 b
            - Kepler-62 f'
            - Kepler-452 b


### Observation

    Of the 8 Planets discovered from this research, Kepler-442 b seems to be more habitable than earth based on comparison with other
    experiments.
